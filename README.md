I evaluated the food hygiene rating data to help journalists and food critics decide where to investigate in the future.

First, I set up a MongoDB database named uk_food with a collection named establishments, then I imported data from the establishments.json file.

Next, I confirmed that the database loaded properly through Jupyter Notebook.

Afterward, I updated the database by adding a new restaurant and removing all establishments from Dover, per instructions. Additionally, some number values were changed from strings to numbers.

Finally, specific queries were run to find health and safety information on various establishments.
